# Around The U.S

## What is this?

This page will allow users to crete and share photos taken in the real world. Furthermore, users will be able to display their content, in an easy to use and adaptive format.

## How was this created?

Around the U.S was created using VScode that utilized both Grid and Flex-box layouts.

As mentioned above, using "Display: grid" allowed for an adaptive layout where photos would be posted. With the use of "grid-template-columns," users can add new photos which would be added cleanly after the preivous one.

## Multiple Displays

Around The U.S was created to fit multiple screen sizes. Starting with a display of 1280px, the base of Around the U.S was laid out. From there, using "@media," I was able to creat adaptive layouts for moblie, tablets, and monitors.

## Future Plans

In the near future, there are plans to add more layouts for different screen resolutions. Adding the ability to upload videos along with photos.
